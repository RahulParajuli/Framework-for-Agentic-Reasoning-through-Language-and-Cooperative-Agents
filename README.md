# ðŸ§  Agentic AI Systems and Multi-Agent Prompt Engineering

A research framework for building and experimenting with agentic AI systems. This project explores **multi-agent architectures**, **prompt-driven reasoning**, and **LLM-based autonomy**, with a focus on orchestrating dynamic, language-mediated interactions between intelligent agents.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository serves as a sandbox for:

- Designing and simulating **multi-agent systems** with autonomous behavior
- Developing **agentic control frameworks** driven by prompts and task goals
- Investigating **inter-agent communication**, tool use, and cooperation
- Prototyping **LLM-powered agents** that reason, plan, and adapt in distributed environments

The work is inspired by ongoing research in **cognitive architectures**, **language model orchestration**, and **autonomous agent systems**.

## ðŸ§ª Example Use Cases

- Task delegation across multiple LLM-powered agents  
- Emergent cooperation and role specialization  
- Prompt-based simulation of strategic reasoning  
- Meta-agent monitoring and self-reflection

---

## ðŸ“š Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI GPT / Claude / LLaMA / Groq (via APIs or local)
- LangChain, CrewAI, or custom orchestrators (optional)
- FastAPI / Flask (for agent server deployment)
- Weights & Biases / MLflow (optional logging integrations)
